# Playing Court Reservation App

Welcome to the "Playing Court Reservation" Android application repository, developed in Kotlin by
Group 26 for the Mobile Application Development course at Politecnico di Torino (academic year
2022-23). The app was developed using an XML-based approach along with several Android libraries,
including AndroidX, Material Design, Room Persistence, and Desugaring.

## Overall Idea

The purpose of the application is to connect Italian-based users to play various types of football
sports (e.g., beach soccer, 5-a-side football, etc.) at local sport centers. The app helps users
find available sport centers in their cities and reserve a court to play. Users can search for sport
centers based on certain filters and can also choose the type of football sport they want to play.
Users can choose additional services, such as renting equipment, if available at the sport center.
Payment for court reservations and additional services is made on-site, rather than through the app.
