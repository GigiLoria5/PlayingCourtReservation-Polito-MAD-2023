# Playing Court Reservation App

Welcome to the "Playing Court Reservation" Android application repository, developed in Kotlin by
Group 26 for the Mobile Application Development course at Politecnico di Torino (academic year
2022-23).

## Introduction

The app was developed using an XML-based approach along with several Android libraries, including
AndroidX, Material Design, and Desugaring. In addition to these technologies, Firebase was also used
for various functionalities, such as authentication, real-time database and storage.

## App Overview and Purpose

The purpose of the application is to connect Italy-based users to play various types of football
sports (e.g., beach soccer, 5-a-side football, etc.) at local sport centers. The app helps users
find available sport centers in their cities and reserve a court to play. Users can search for sport
centers based on certain filters and can also choose the type of football sport they want to play.
Users can choose additional services, such as renting equipment, if available at the sport center.
Payment for court reservations and additional services is made on-site, rather than through the app.

## Court Reservation, Availability, and Reviews

Users can search for available courts or fields by location, sport, or date and time and view court
or field availability and prices in real-time. They can make a reservation and receive a
confirmation, as well as cancel or modify an existing reservation. Users can also rate and review
courts or fields based on their quality and facilities.

## Notification System, Calendar View, and Inviting New Players

The app includes a notification system that sends users updates on their reserved games and
invitations received or sent. Users can also view their reservations through a calendar view,
allowing them to keep track of their upcoming games. For games that they manage, users can invite
new players based on specific filters, such as skill level or position, making it easier to find and
play with other sports enthusiasts.

## User Profile Management

The app allows users to manage their own profile, choosing the sports they are interested in and
declaring their own mastery level and achievements.
